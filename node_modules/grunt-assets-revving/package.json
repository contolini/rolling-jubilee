Attempts to ignore external resources.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall this grunt plugin next to your project's gruntfile with:\n\n`npm install grunt-assets-revving`\n\nThen add this line somewhere in your `grunt.js`:\n\n```javascript\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-assets-revving');\n```\n\nInside your `grunt.js` file add a section named `rev`.\n\n### files ```string|array```\n\nArray of your static files (or string for single file).\n\n## Config Example\n\n``` javascript\nrev: {\n  assets: {\n    files: [\n      'index.html',\n      'subdir/index.html'\n    ],\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nRunning `grunt rev` will scan `index.html` and `subdir/index.html` line-by-line looking for linked `.css` and `.js` files. If any are found, a Unix timestamp is appended to their URL and the file is written to disk, overwriting the source file. Make sure to save changes to files before running!\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Chris Contolini\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
